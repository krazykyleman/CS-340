### 1. How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

- **Maintainable**: By following coding standards, writing modular code, and adding meaningful comments, I ensure that the code is maintainable. For the CRUD Python module in Project One, I encapsulated the database operations, making it easier to update or modify without affecting other parts of the code.
- **Readable**: I use descriptive variable names, consistent indentation, and clear code structure to make the code readable. This helps other developers understand the code quickly.
- **Adaptable**: The CRUD module was designed to be reusable and extendable. Its advantages include flexibility and efficiency, as it can be easily adapted for other projects that require similar database operations.

### 2. How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?

- **Analyzing Requirements**: I started by understanding Grazioso Salvare's requirements for the database and dashboard. I broke down the problem into smaller tasks and planned the development process.
- **Iterative Development**: Unlike previous assignments, this project required a more complex and iterative approach. I developed and tested each component separately, ensuring that they met the client's needs.
- **Future Strategies**: In the future, I would use data modeling, client collaboration, and prototyping to create databases that meet various client requests.

### 3. What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?

- **Problem Solving**: Computer scientists analyze problems and develop solutions using technology. In this project, I created a dashboard that helps Grazioso Salvare identify and categorize available dogs for training.
- **Impact on Business**: My work on this project would help Grazioso Salvare streamline their operations, make informed decisions, and ultimately save lives through their rescue-animal training programs.
